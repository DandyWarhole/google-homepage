# google-homepage
First css/html project on The Odin Project webdev curriculum

The aim of this project was to create a website that looks like Main google search website, for the country that I am currently in (In this case its Denmark). It was supposed to be done with omitting all the functionality of the page, focusing just on the looks.
The directions advised not to go for a perfect representation, and rather focus on creating as much with my own skills, before relying on developer tools. However, I did not see that in the beginning, so I was using the developer tools pretty heavy at the start, only later trying to figure out as much as possible by myself.
The project testes basic skills of HTML and CSS, creating a structure of the document and then precisely styling each of them. It taught me about layout, positioning, the fact that I had a very superficial understanding of what certain commands do (god bless google) and that it is easy to create a lot of redundant elements, since for some reason it seems easier that way.
I was struggling a lot on some aspects, such as styling the form, but I discovered that what seemed to be a roadblock one day was almost always solved the next day. Viva sleep and breaks!
In general i had a lot of fun.
